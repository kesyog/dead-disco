# dead-disco

More fun times following the [Rust embedded discovery book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery)
with some others at Fitbit and otherwise poking around now that I have a real STM32F3DISCOVERY
board.

Mostly filling in the gaps I couldn't get to when running through the exercises with a less-featured
Nucleo board.

All exercises and experiments are in the examples folder.
